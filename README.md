# RhythmiQ-Music-Genre-Classification
RhythmiQ is a deep learning-based music genre classification project that leverages CNN and LSTM + SVM models to achieve high accuracy. Using the GTZAN audio dataset, we extract MFCC (Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients) features from 3-second audio clips, creating a dataset of 10,000 samples for training and evaluation.
